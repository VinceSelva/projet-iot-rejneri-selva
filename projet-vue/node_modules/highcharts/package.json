  "readme": "Highcharts is a JavaScript charting library based on SVG, with fallbacks to VML and canvas for old browsers. This package also contains Highstock, the financial charting package, and Highmaps for geo maps.\n\nThis package is intended for supporting client-side JavaScript charting through bundlers like Parcel or Webpack and environments like Babel or TypeScript. If you indend to generate static charts on the server side, use the [Highcharts node.js Export Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/highcharts-export-server) instead.\n\n* Official website: [www.highcharts.com](http://www.highcharts.com)\n* Download page: [www.highcharts.com/download](http://www.highcharts.com/download)\n* Licensing: [www.highcharts.com/license](http://www.highcharts.com/license)\n* Support: [www.highcharts.com/support](http://www.highcharts.com/support)\n* Issues: [Working repo](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues)\n\n## Download and install Highcharts\nPlease note that there are several ways to use Highcharts. For general installation instructions, see [the docs](http://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/installation).\n### Use our CDN\nInstead of downloading, you can use our CDN to access files directly. See [code.highcharts.com](https://code.highcharts.com) for details.\n```\n<script src=\"https://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js\"></script>\n```\n### Install from npm\nSee [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/) on how to get started with npm.\n```\nnpm install --save highcharts\n```\n\n### Install from Bower\nSee [Bower documentation](https://bower.io/) on how to get started with Bower.\n```\nbower install highcharts\n```\n\n## Load Highcharts as a CommonJS module\nHighcharts is using an UMD module pattern, as a result it has support for CommonJS.\n*The following examples presumes you are using npm to install Highcharts, see [Download and install Highcharts](#download-and-install-highcharts) for more details.*\n```js\n// Load Highcharts\nvar Highcharts = require('highcharts');\n// Alternatively, this is how to load Highstock. Highmaps is similar.\n// var Highcharts = require('highcharts/highstock');\n\n// Load the exporting module, and initialize it.\nrequire('highcharts/modules/exporting')(Highcharts);\n\n// Generate the chart\nHighcharts.chart('container', {\n  // options - see https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts\n});\n```\n\n## Load Highcharts as an ES6 module\nSince Highcharts supports CommonJS, it can be loaded as an ES6 module with the use of transpilers. Two common transpilers are [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). These have different interpretations of a CommonJS module, which affects your syntax.\n*The following examples presumes you are using npm to install Highcharts, see [Download and install Highcharts](#download-and-install-highcharts) for more details.*\n### Babel\n```js\nimport Highcharts from 'highcharts';\n// Alternatively, this is how to load Highstock. Highmaps is similar.\n// import Highcharts from 'highcharts/highstock';\n\n// Load the exporting module.\nimport Exporting from 'highcharts/modules/exporting';\n// Initialize exporting module.\nExporting(Highcharts);\n\n// Generate the chart\nHighcharts.chart('container', {\n  // options - see https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts\n});\n```\n### TypeScript\n```js\nimport * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';\n// Alternatively, this is how to load Highstock. Highmaps is similar.\n// import Highcharts from 'highcharts/highstock';\n\n// Load the exporting module.\nimport * as Exporting from 'highcharts/modules/exporting';\n// Initialize exporting module.\nExporting(Highcharts);\n\n// Generate the chart\nHighcharts.chart('container', {\n  // options - see https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts\n});\n```\n\n",
